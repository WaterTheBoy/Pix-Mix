I wanted to add the abiliy for images to retain their Alpha, if available. But that would have delayed things too long.

There's also an issue where the Command Prompt keeps showing up on screen and going away, because the multiprocessing doesn't work well on windows.

I also found that some images still don't scale to fit the image background box.

Files output ass PixeMixed and not PixMixed.
That typo will haunt me forever.

The height doesn't seem to adjust to the frame, in the same way width does.

BUT!
It's good enough for me!
