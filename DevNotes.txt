I wanted to add the ability for images to retain their Alpha, if available. But that would have delayed things too long.

There's also an issue where the Command Prompt keeps showing up on the screen and going away because the multiprocessing doesn't work well on Windows.

I also found that some images still don't scale to fit the image background box.

Files output ass PixeMixed and not PixMixed.
That typo will haunt me forever.

The height doesn't adjust to the frame, as the width does.

BUT!
It's good enough for me!
